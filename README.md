A Discord Bot for playing Tic-Tac-Toe.

## Play against the bot
**This is the equivalent of my [Tic-Tac-Toe website](https://github.com/puncher1/tictactoe-website), which comes with an AI based on the minimax algorithm.**

### Difficulty 
There are 3 difficulty levels:
* **easy:** The "AI" (if you still can tell this AI) just picks a field randomly. This makes it really easy for the player to win.
* **medium:** The AI chooses either a random field or if the AI or player needs a field to win, it chooses that field. This makes it more difficult, but still winnable.
* **impossible:** The AI uses the minimax algorithm for every choose of its field. This makes it impossible to win. The player either makes a draw or loses.
